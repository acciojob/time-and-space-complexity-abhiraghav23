	<h1> Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p> 
Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size, 
𝑛
n. It helps in determining the efficiency of an algorithm by analyzing how its runtime increases as the input size grows</p>
 <p> <b>Space complexity </b> refers to the amount of memory that an algorithm requires to run, in addition to the input data storage.  For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n)
